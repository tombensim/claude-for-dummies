## Skills

| # | Skill | What it teaches |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 0 | **cc4d-00-getting-started** | Your first conversation with Claude Code — from zero to "I made that" |
| 1 | **cc4d-01-describing-what-you-want** | How to explain your ideas in plain language |
| 2 | **cc4d-02-the-loop** | The core workflow: build → look → give feedback → improve → repeat |
| 3 | **cc4d-03-shipping** | Put your thing on the internet with a URL you can share |

## Stack

These skills assume a simple, opinionated setup:

- **GitHub** — where your project lives (via `gh` CLI)
- **Vercel** — where your project goes live (zero-config deploys)
- **Agentation** — how you give visual feedback (click on elements, annotate what to change)

## Philosophy

- You don't need to learn to code. You need to learn to describe what you want.
- Build first, understand later. Action before explanation.
- The iteration loop is the skill. Everything else is just the first and last step.
- Plain language is the interface. If you can describe it, Claude can build it.
