But once a user has a live project, they need ongoing workflows: adding features, fixing bugs, implementing feedback, changing design. Today, clicking a recent project dumps you back into `/build` at whatever step you left off, with no clear UX for these iterative tasks. The linear step system doesn't accommodate \"go back and keep working.\"\n\n**The long-term value of CC4D isn't the first build — it's the ongoing relationship.** Building is a one-time event; maintaining and evolving is where users spend most of their time.\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n\n**Maria** — built a portfolio site last week. Wants to add a \"Contact Me\" form. She doesn't need setup or scaffolding. She needs to describe what she wants, watch it happen, and deploy.\n\n**Yossi** — his landing page has a broken mobile layout. A friend found the bug. He needs to explain the issue, have Claude fix it, verify, and deploy.\n\n**Dani** — got feedback that her event registration is confusing. She wants to paste the feedback, have Claude improve the flow, review the changes, and push live.\n\n**Amir** — changed his mind about his site's colors. Wants to describe the new look, see it in preview, and deploy when happy.\n\n### Common Pattern\n\nAll iterative workflows share:\n1. **Resume context** — Claude needs to understand the existing project (CLAUDE.md + git history already provide this)\n2. **Express intent** — User describes what they want\n3. **Watch it happen** — Same build experience with live preview\n4. **Review & iterate** — Same feedback loop as step 5\n5. **Deploy update** — Push changes live\n\nThe difference from \"build from scratch\": no setup, no scaffolding, no idea gathering. The user arrives with a **specific task**, not a blank canvas.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed UX: Two Modes\n\n### Mode 1: Guided Build (existing, unchanged)\n- Linear 9-step wizard\n- For brand-new projects\n- Mascot guides you through every step\n\n### Mode 2: Workspace (new)\n- Free-form, task-oriented\n- For returning to existing projects (step 4+ completed)\n- Same chat + preview layout, different chrome and entry point\n\nThe mode is **automatically determined**: if a project has completed at least step 4 (first build exists), it opens in Workspace mode. Mid-wizard projects resume the wizard.\n\n---\n\n## Design: Welcome Page as Project Hub\n\n### Current\n- Flat list of recent projects as small horizontal cards\n- One big \"Start Building\" CTA\n- No project status info\n\n### Proposed\n- **Returning users** (have projects): Projects are the hero, \"Build something new\" is secondary\n- **New users** (no projects): \"Build something new\" is the hero with full onboarding\n\nEach project card shows:\n- Project name\n- **Status badge**: \"Live\" (green, has vercel URL), \"Local\" (yellow, built but not deployed), \"In Progress\" (building)\n- Last activity time\n- Live URL (if deployed) as a subtle link\n\n```\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  [Mascot waving]                                  │\n│  \"Hi!

The project is past the wizard.\n2. **Context loading** — Read CLAUDE.md (already has all CAPTURE data from steps 1-9), `git log --oneline -10` for recent history\n3. **Dev server** — Start `npm run dev` if not already running\n4. **Wait for user** — Don't send an introductory message. The user's first message IS the task.\n5. **Task execution** — Same principles: plain language, fix don't instruct, pick sensible defaults\n6. **Deployment** — When user says \"deploy\" or clicks the button, run `git add -A && git commit && vercel --prod --yes`\n\n### Initial Prompt Format (Desktop → Agent)\n\nFor workspace mode, the desktop app sends a **system context message** (not a user prompt):\n\n```\n[WORKSPACE MODE]\nThe user is returning to an existing project. Do NOT run the step system.\nRead CLAUDE.md for project context.

User can expand to review, but focus is on the new task. On each new workspace entry, archive the previous session.\n2. **Dev server**: Auto-start on entry — preview appears immediately when opening the project. Feels responsive and alive.\n3. **Deploy**: Header button + chat — a Deploy button always visible in the workspace header AND available as a chat command.

This is a structured, step-by-step process. You do not decide what step you're on — the progress script does.\n    13→\n    14→## How This Works\n    15→\n    16→1. Run `bash scripts/progress.sh next` to get your current step instructions\n    17→2. Follow the ACTION in the step\n    18→3. Verify the CHECK passes\n    19→4. Save what you learned to CLAUDE.md (every step has a CAPTURE section)\n    20→5. Run `bash scripts/progress.sh complete N` to advance to the next step\n    21→6. Repeat\n    22→\n    23→**Never skip steps. Never guess what step you're on. Always ask the progress script.**\n    24→\n    25→## Rules\n    26→\n    27→- Use plain language. No jargon. If you must use a technical term, explain it in parentheses.\n    28→- Action first, explanation second. Do things, then tell them what you did.\n    29→- Fix, don't instruct. When something is broken, fix it yourself.\n    30→- Only pause for genuine user action: account signups, giving feedback, making decisions.\n    31→- Permission key is **Enter** to approve, **Escape** to deny. Never say \"press Y\".\n    32→- No time promises. Never say \"30 seconds\" or \"in a minute\". Never set timeouts on commands — if a command might take a while, use `run_in_background: true` instead.\n    33→- Long-running commands (`npx create-next-app`, `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npx vercel`) **must** use `run_in_background: true`. Never use `&` to background a command. Never set a timeout hoping it'll finish in time. Use `TaskOutput` to check on progress or wait for completion.\n    34→- Pick sensible defaults. Never ask the user to choose between technical options.\n    35→- After EVERY step, update CLAUDE.md with what the CAPTURE section specifies. This is critical — if the user leaves and comes back, CLAUDE.md is all you have.\n    36→\n    37→## Starting a Session\n    38→\n    39→**New user (no .cc4d-progress.json):**\n    40→Run `bash scripts/progress.sh next` — it will initialize at Step 1.\n    41→\n    42→**Returning user (.cc4d-progress.json exists):**\n    43→1. Read CLAUDE.md to remember who they are and what they built\n    44→2. Run `bash scripts/progress.sh status` to see where they left off\n    45→3. Greet them by name\n    46→4.

Let me compile a comprehensive report.\n\n---\n\nHere is a thorough breakdown of the desktop app codebase.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Welcome Page (`desktop/src/app/welcome/page.tsx`)\n\n**Project Display:**\n- On mount, calls `window.electronAPI.listProjects()` to load recent projects into local state (`recentProjects: ProjectMeta[]`).\n- If any recent projects exist, renders a horizontally scrollable row of buttons, each showing `project.displayName || project.name` and a relative time label (using the `Project` i18n namespace with keys `justNow`, `yesterday`, `daysAgo`).\n\n**\"Start Building\" flow:**\n1. Calls `window.electronAPI.createProject(\"\", store.locale)` — passes empty idea string and the current locale.\n2. Receives a `ProjectMeta` back and sets `store.projectDir`, `store.activeProjectId`, `store.projectName`.\n3. Calls `store.setStep(2, 0)` — puts the app at **Step 2, Phase 0** (Orient User).\n4. Navigates to `/build`.\n\n**\"Resume project\" flow (handleProjectSwitch):**\n1. Calls `window.electronAPI.switchProject(project.id)`.\n2. Calls `store.loadProject(meta)` — restores all project fields.\n3. If `meta.sessionId` exists, calls `store.setStep(4, 1)` — resumes mid-build.\n4. Navigates to `/build`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Build Page (`desktop/src/app/build/page.tsx`)\n\n**Layout:** Header (drag region) | Chat panel (full or left half) | LivePreview (right half, conditional) | Feedback banner (bottom, conditional).\n\n**Startup logic (3 `useEffect` chains):**\n1. If `store.projectDir` is missing, tries to recover it from `window.electronAPI.getActiveProject()`.\n2. When `store.projectDir` is available, loads persisted milestones via `window.electronAPI.loadMilestones()`.\n3. Once `isLoaded` (chat persistence ready) AND `store.projectDir` is set AND `hasStarted.current` is false:\n   - If `store.messages.length > 0` (restored session): shows a `ConversationRecoveryBanner`, skips auto-prompt.\n   - If `store.sessionId` exists (resuming): skips auto-prompt entirely.\n   - Otherwise: calls `sendToAgent(formatInitialMessage(locale))` — sends \"Hey! I'm ready to start\" (EN) or \"היי! אני מוכן/ה להתחיל\" (HE).\n\n**sendToAgent:** Adds a user message to store, sets `isStreaming: true`, calls `connectToAgent(...)`. Registered callbacks handle:\n- `onDevServerDetected` — polls port 3000 via `electronAPI.pollPort`, sets `store.previewUrl`.\n- `onFileChanged` — increments `refreshTrigger` to force LivePreview reload.\n- `onStepCompleted(step)` — calls `store.completeStep(step)` and `store.setStep(step+1, getPhaseForStep(step+1))`.\n- `onLiveUrl(url)` — sets `store.liveUrl` and persists it via `electronAPI.updateProject`.\n\n**Preview panel:** Shown only when `store.previewUrl` is set (non-null). Chat takes full width otherwise; with preview, both chat and preview take 50%.\n\n**Feedback banner:** Shown when step 4 is in `completedSteps` and `isStreaming` is false.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Store (`desktop/src/lib/store.ts`)\n\nZustand store with `persist` middleware (key: `\"cc4d-desktop-store\"`).\n\n**Key state slices:**\n\n| Slice | Fields |\n|---|---|\n| Session | `sessionId`, `projectDir`, `activeProjectId` |\n| i18n | `locale: \"he\" | \"en\"` |\n| Progress | `currentStep: number`, `phase: number`, `completedSteps: number[]` |\n| Chat | `messages: ChatMessage[]`, `isStreaming`, `messagesLoaded`, `currentActivity` |\n| Project | `projectName`, `liveUrl`, `githubUrl` |\n| User | `userName`, `vibe`, `audience`, `priority`, `designRef`, `idea` |\n| Project drawer | `projectDrawerOpen`, `milestones: ProjectMilestone[]` |\n| Runtime | `runtimeReady`, `claudeAuthenticated` |\n| Preview | `previewUrl`, `previewMode: \"desktop\" | \"mobile\"` |\n\n**Persisted fields:** `locale`, `sessionId`, `projectDir`, `activeProjectId`, `currentStep`, `phase`, `completedSteps`, `projectName`, `liveUrl`, `githubUrl`, `userName`, `vibe`, `idea`. (Messages are NOT persisted via Zustand — they use a separate file-based persistence hook.)\n\n**`ChatMessage` type:**\n```ts\n{\n  id: string;\n  role: \"user\" | \"assistant\" | \"status\";\n  content: string;\n  timestamp: number;\n  toolName?: string;\n  toolInput?: { file_path?: string; command?: string };\n  questionData?: {\n    questions: Array<{\n      question: string;\n      options: Array<{ label: string; description: string }>;\n    }>;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**`ProjectMeta` type:**\n```ts\n{\n  id, name, displayName, path, createdAt, lastOpenedAt,\n  sessionId, locale, vibe, audience, priority, designRef, liveUrl, githubUrl\n}\n```\n\n**`loadProject(meta)`** restores all project fields and resets transient state (messages loaded by persistence hook separately).\n\n**`reset()`** returns the store to `initialState` (default locale is `\"he\"`).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Agent Client (`desktop/src/lib/agent-client.ts`)\n\n**`connectToAgent(options)`:**\n- POSTs to `/api/agent` with `{ prompt, locale, projectDir, sessionId }`.\n- Reads the SSE response stream line by line.\n- On `data: [DONE]` — calls `onDone()`.\n- Otherwise parses each JSON line via `parseAgentEvent(...)`.\n- Captures `session_id` from `result` events and calls `onSessionId`.\n- Handles block deduplication: Claude CLI stream-json sends cumulative `assistant` events (each event contains ALL blocks so far), so `lastAssistantBlockCount` tracks how many blocks have already been processed, and `skipBlocks` is passed to `parseAgentEvent` to only process new ones.\n- Returns `{ abort() }` which calls `controller.abort()`.\n\n**`parseAgentEvent(raw, locale, callbacks?, skipBlocks)`:**\n\n| Event type | Action |\n|---|---|\n| `system`, `rate_limit_event`, `user` | Skipped (null message) |\n| `assistant` + text block | Returns `{ role: \"assistant\", content: text }`. Scans for Vercel URL (`*.vercel.app`), calls `onLiveUrl`. |\n| `assistant` + `Bash` tool | Translates command to friendly status message. Detects `npm run dev` → calls `onDevServerDetected`. Detects `progress.sh complete N` → calls `onStepCompleted(N)`. |\n| `assistant` + `Write` tool | Returns status \"Creating filename...\" + calls `onFileChanged`. |\n| `assistant` + `Edit` tool | Returns status \"Editing filename...\" + calls `onFileChanged`. |\n| `assistant` + `Glob/Grep/Read` | Skipped (null). |\n| `assistant` + `AskUserQuestion` | Returns `{ role: \"assistant\", toolName: \"AskUserQuestion\", questionData: toolInput }`. |\n| `result` error | Returns generic error status message. |\n| `result` success | Returns null (content already streamed). |\n\n**`/api/agent` route (`desktop/src/app/api/agent/route.ts`):**\n- Spawns `claude --print --output-format stream-json --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose [--resume sessionId] [prompt]`.\n- `stdin: \"ignore\"` (critical — piped stdin causes claude to hang).\n- Deletes `CLAUDECODE` env var to allow nesting.\n- `cwd` set to `projectDir`.\n- Streams stdout as SSE `data:` lines. Stderr warnings forwarded as error events if they contain \"Error\".\n\n---\n\n## 5. Chat Components (`desktop/src/components/chat/`)\n\n**ChatPanel.tsx:** Composes the chat column in this order:\n1. `ConversationRecoveryBanner` — shown when a session was restored\n2. `PlanningHeader` — shown during planning phase (steps 1–3)\n3. `ChatHistory` — scrollable message list\n4. `LiveActivityBar` — live \"Building...\" status bar\n5. `ChatInput` — text input + send button\n\n**ChatHistory.tsx:** Reads `store.messages`, pipes them through `buildActivityBlocks()` (from `@/lib/activity-blocks`), then renders each as `<ActivityBlockView>`. Auto-scrolls on message changes. The last block is marked `isActive: true` while streaming.\n\n**ChatInput.tsx:** Simple controlled input. Disabled while `isStreaming`. On submit, calls `onSend(input.trim())`.\n\n**QuestionCard.tsx:** Renders `AskUserQuestion` tool output as clickable option buttons. Clicking a button calls `onAnswer(opt.label)`, which feeds back into the agent.\n\n**LiveActivityBar.tsx:** Animated bar at the bottom of the chat (above input). Visible only when `isStreaming && currentActivity`. Shows a spinner + the current activity text (e.g., \"Setting up your project...\").\n\n**PlanningHeader.tsx:** Shown when `currentStep <= 3`. Displays the mascot image, \"Let's plan your project\" title, and subtitle. Animates out when step advances past 3.\n\n**Message.tsx, AssistantMessage.tsx, UserMessage.tsx, BuildingBlock.tsx, ErrorMessage.tsx, ActivityBlockView.tsx** — Individual message display components (inferred from file listing).\n\n**ConversationRecoveryBanner.tsx** — Banner shown when a conversation was restored from disk.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Step Indicator (`desktop/src/components/progress/StepIndicator.tsx`)\n\nReads `currentStep` and `completedSteps` from store. Displays:\n- Phase labels: iterates `PHASES`, marks each as `isActive` (current step in that phase's step list) or `isDone` (all steps in phase completed).\n- A progress bar: `completedSteps.length / TOTAL_STEPS * 100` width.\n\nUses `PhaseLabel` sub-component (not fully explored but referenced).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Progress Config (`desktop/src/lib/progress-config.ts`)\n\n```ts\nexport const PHASES = [\n  { phase: 0, steps: [1, 2], key: \"phase0\" },  // Setup\n  { phase: 1, steps: [3, 4], key: \"phase1\" },  // Build\n  { phase: 2, steps: [5, 6], key: \"phase2\" },  // Improve\n  { phase: 3, steps: [7, 8, 9], key: \"phase3\" }, // Launch\n] as const;\n\nexport const TOTAL_STEPS = 9;\n\nexport function getPhaseForStep(step: number): number {\n  if (step <= 2) return 0;\n  if (step <= 4) return 1;\n  if (step <= 6) return 2;\n  return 3;\n}\n```\n\n**Step-to-phase mapping:**\n- Steps 1–2: Phase 0 (Setup)\n- Steps 3–4: Phase 1 (Build)\n- Steps 5–6: Phase 2 (Improve)\n- Steps 7–9: Phase 3 (Launch)\n\n---\n\n## 8. Milestone Extractor (`desktop/src/lib/milestone-extractor.ts`)\n\n**`extractMilestone(msg, locale)`:** Inspects a `ChatMessage` and returns a `ProjectMilestone | null`:\n- `create-next-app` or `npm init` → `type: \"build\"`, label \"Project created\"\n- `npm run dev` or `next dev` → `type: \"build\"`, label \"First version built\"\n- `vercel` or `deploy` → `type: \"publish\"`, label \"Site published\"\n- `Write` or `Edit` tool → `type: \"change\"`, label \"Edited: filename\"\n- Assistant text with `vercel.app` or \"your site is live\" → `type: \"publish\"`, label \"Site is live!\"\n\n**`createMilestoneThrottler(locale)`:** Returns a throttled version of `extractMilestone`. File-change milestones (`type: \"change\"`) are deduplicated within a 10-second window and generalized to \"Made changes\".\n\n**`ProjectMilestone` type:**\n```ts\n{ id: string; type: \"choice\" | \"build\" | \"change\" | \"publish\" | \"other\"; label: string; timestamp: number; }\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. i18n Messages\n\nBoth `en.json` and `he.json` share the same structure. Key namespaces:\n\n| Namespace | Purpose |\n|---|---|\n| `App` | App title and logo text |\n| `Setup` | Pre-build loading/setup screen |\n| `Welcome` | Welcome page — greetings, vibe/audience/priority options, \"Start Building\" |\n| `Build` | Build page — status messages, chat input, preview controls |\n| `Ship` | Publishing flow messages |\n| `Done` | Completion screen |\n| `Progress` | Phase labels: \"Setup\", \"Build\", \"Improve\", \"Launch\" |\n| `Errors` | Error messages |\n| `Project` | Relative time labels (\"Just now\", \"Yesterday\", \"N days ago\") |\n| `Planning` | Planning header: \"Let's plan your project\" + subtitle |\n| `Chat` | \"Conversation restored\" banner |\n| `Agent` | Agent status messages |\n| `ProjectPanel` | Project drawer: choices, timeline, activity log, quick actions, step labels (step1–step9), phase labels |\n\nThe `ProjectPanel` namespace has full step labels:\n- step1: \"Check environment\" / \"בדיקת סביבה\"\n- step2: \"Meet & greet\" / \"היכרות\"\n- step3: \"Gather ideas\" / \"איסוף רעיונות\"\n- step4: \"Build first version\" / \"בניית גרסה ראשונה\"\n- step5: \"Review together\" / \"סקירה משותפת\"\n- step6: \"Make improvements\" / \"שיפורים\"\n- step7: \"Final check\" / \"בדיקה אחרונה\"\n- step8: \"Publish online\" / \"פרסום באינטרנט\"\n- step9: \"Celebrate!\" / \"חגיגה!\"\n\n---\n\n## 10. CC4D Skill (`skills/cc4d/SKILL.md`)\n\n9 steps across 4 phases, driven by `bash scripts/progress.sh`:\n\n| Phase | Steps | What happens |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0: Setup | 1–2 | Environment check (`01-check-environment.sh`), Orient user (warm greeting) |\n| 1: Build | 3–4 | Gather idea via `AskUserQuestion` (vibe/audience/priority/design ref), Scaffold Next.js + agentation + build |\n| 2: Iterate | 5–6 | React & iterate (feedback loop), Save progress |\n| 3: Shipping | 7–9 | Offer to ship, GitHub + Vercel deploy, Celebrate |\n\nKey rules: `progress.sh complete N` is what triggers `onStepCompleted(N)` in the frontend (detected via bash command pattern match `progress\\.sh\\s+complete\\s+(\\d+)`). The skill uses `AskUserQuestion` tool for structured choices. Long-running commands must use `run_in_background: true`.\n\n**Step 3 (Gather idea):** Uses `AskUserQuestion` to collect vibe (4 options), audience (4 options), priority (4 options), design reference (Yes/No). If user provides a design URL, Claude uses WebFetch to analyze it. If \"surprise me\", Claude internally generates a detailed spec but does NOT show it to the user.\n\n**Step 4 (Scaffold and Build):** `npx create-next-app`, install `agentation`, create `app/agentation-wrapper.tsx` (must be `\"use client\"`), run `npm run build` to verify before showing the user, then `npm run dev`.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Types (`desktop/src/types/electron-api.d.ts`)\n\nDeclares `window.electronAPI` with these methods:\n- `getSystemLocale()` → `\"he\" | \"en\"`\n- `getRuntimeStatus()` → `{ nodeReady, gitReady, claudeReady }`\n- `openProject(path)` — opens folder in OS file explorer\n- `createProject(idea, locale)` → `ProjectMeta`\n- `listProjects()` → `ProjectMeta[]`\n- `switchProject(id)` → `ProjectMeta | null`\n- `updateProject(id, updates)` → `ProjectMeta | null`\n- `getActiveProject()` → `ProjectMeta | null`\n- `openExternal(url)` — opens URL in system browser\n- `onAgentMessage/onAgentError` — IPC event listeners\n- `loadChatHistory(projectPath)` / `saveChatHistory(projectPath, messages)` — file-based persistence\n- `finalizePreferences(projectId, { idea, vibe, audience, priority, designRef })` — saves onboarding choices\n- `pollPort(port)` → `boolean` — checks if a local port is accepting connections\n- `loadMilestones/saveMilestones` — per-project milestone persistence\n- `getLogPath()`, `logToFile(level, message)` — logging\n- `platform: string`, `isPackaged: boolean` — platform info\n\n---\n\n## 12. PlanningHeader (`desktop/src/components/chat/PlanningHeader.tsx`)\n\nVisible when `currentStep <= 3`. Shows:\n- Mascot image (waving pose, 120×120)\n- `t(\"Planning.title\")` = \"Let's plan your project\"\n- `t(\"Planning.subtitle\")` = \"I'll ask a few questions so I can build exactly what you need\"\n\nAnimates out (height collapses, opacity fades) when step advances to 4+.\n\n---\n\n## 13. Project Components (`desktop/src/components/project/`)\n\n**ProjectDrawer.tsx:** Full-height side drawer (380px wide). In RTL (Hebrew), slides from the right; in LTR slides from the left. Contains:\n1. `ProjectIdentityCard` — mascot + project name + phase badge + \"Live\" link button\n2. `ProjectChoicesCard` — vibe/audience/priority/designRef rows (hidden if no choices made)\n3. `ProjectTimeline` — 9-step visual timeline with phase grouping, completed/active/pending states\n4. `ProjectActivityLog` — chronological list of milestones (newest first, max 20)\n5. `ProjectQuickActions` — \"Open folder\", \"Visit site\", \"New project\" buttons (with confirmation for new project)\n\n**ProjectDrawerToggle.tsx:** A `PanelLeft` icon button that calls `store.toggleProjectDrawer()`.\n\n**ProjectTimeline.tsx:** Renders all 9 steps grouped by phase. Each step shows a circle (filled black = completed, yellow ring = current, empty = pending) and its translated label from `ProjectPanel.step1`–`step9`.\n\n**ProjectChoicesCard.tsx:** Shows `vibe`, `audience`, `priority`, `designRef` as icon rows. Hidden entirely if no choices exist yet.\n\n**ProjectIdentityCard.tsx:** Shows `store.idea` as project display name, current phase badge, and a \"Live\" button if `store.liveUrl` is set.\n\n**ProjectActivityLog.tsx:** Milestone entries with type icons (sparkles for choice, hammer for build, pencil for change, rocket for publish). Timestamps formatted as HH:MM.\n\n**ProjectQuickActions.tsx:** Pinned to drawer bottom. Has a \"start new project\" confirmation dialog that triggers on the New Project button when `isStreaming` is true."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a8d27af (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 65815\ntool_uses: 32\nduration_ms: 140894</usage>"}]}]},"uuid":"859c90dc-a567-4e02-bb40-e3c343b3e6fb","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:52:57.135Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the desktop app codebase thoroughly to understand the current implementation.

Welcome Page (`desktop/src/app/welcome/page.tsx`)\n\n**Project Display:**\n- On mount, calls `window.electronAPI.listProjects()` to load recent projects into local state (`recentProjects: ProjectMeta[]`).\n- If any recent projects exist, renders a horizontally scrollable row of buttons, each showing `project.displayName || project.name` and a relative time label (using the `Project` i18n namespace with keys `justNow`, `yesterday`, `daysAgo`).\n\n**\"Start Building\" flow:**\n1. Calls `window.electronAPI.createProject(\"\", store.locale)` — passes empty idea string and the current locale.\n2. Receives a `ProjectMeta` back and sets `store.projectDir`, `store.activeProjectId`, `store.projectName`.\n3. Calls `store.setStep(2, 0)` — puts the app at **Step 2, Phase 0** (Orient User).\n4. Navigates to `/build`.\n\n**\"Resume project\" flow (handleProjectSwitch):**\n1. Calls `window.electronAPI.switchProject(project.id)`.\n2. Calls `store.loadProject(meta)` — restores all project fields.\n3. If `meta.sessionId` exists, calls `store.setStep(4, 1)` — resumes mid-build.\n4. Navigates to `/build`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Build Page (`desktop/src/app/build/page.tsx`)\n\n**Layout:** Header (drag region) | Chat panel (full or left half) | LivePreview (right half, conditional) | Feedback banner (bottom, conditional).\n\n**Startup logic (3 `useEffect` chains):**\n1. If `store.projectDir` is missing, tries to recover it from `window.electronAPI.getActiveProject()`.\n2. When `store.projectDir` is available, loads persisted milestones via `window.electronAPI.loadMilestones()`.\n3. Once `isLoaded` (chat persistence ready) AND `store.projectDir` is set AND `hasStarted.current` is false:\n   - If `store.messages.length > 0` (restored session): shows a `ConversationRecoveryBanner`, skips auto-prompt.\n   - If `store.sessionId` exists (resuming): skips auto-prompt entirely.\n   - Otherwise: calls `sendToAgent(formatInitialMessage(locale))` — sends \"Hey! I'm ready to start\" (EN) or \"היי! אני מוכן/ה להתחיל\" (HE).\n\n**sendToAgent:** Adds a user message to store, sets `isStreaming: true`, calls `connectToAgent(...)`. Registered callbacks handle:\n- `onDevServerDetected` — polls port 3000 via `electronAPI.pollPort`, sets `store.previewUrl`.\n- `onFileChanged` — increments `refreshTrigger` to force LivePreview reload.\n- `onStepCompleted(step)` — calls `store.completeStep(step)` and `store.setStep(step+1, getPhaseForStep(step+1))`.\n- `onLiveUrl(url)` — sets `store.liveUrl` and persists it via `electronAPI.updateProject`.\n\n**Preview panel:** Shown only when `store.previewUrl` is set (non-null). Chat takes full width otherwise; with preview, both chat and preview take 50%.\n\n**Feedback banner:** Shown when step 4 is in `completedSteps` and `isStreaming` is false.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Store (`desktop/src/lib/store.ts`)\n\nZustand store with `persist` middleware (key: `\"cc4d-desktop-store\"`).\n\n**Key state slices:**\n\n| Slice | Fields |\n|---|---|\n| Session | `sessionId`, `projectDir`, `activeProjectId` |\n| i18n | `locale: \"he\" | \"en\"` |\n| Progress | `currentStep: number`, `phase: number`, `completedSteps: number[]` |\n| Chat | `messages: ChatMessage[]`, `isStreaming`, `messagesLoaded`, `currentActivity` |\n| Project | `projectName`, `liveUrl`, `githubUrl` |\n| User | `userName`, `vibe`, `audience`, `priority`, `designRef`, `idea` |\n| Project drawer | `projectDrawerOpen`, `milestones: ProjectMilestone[]` |\n| Runtime | `runtimeReady`, `claudeAuthenticated` |\n| Preview | `previewUrl`, `previewMode: \"desktop\" | \"mobile\"` |\n\n**Persisted fields:** `locale`, `sessionId`, `projectDir`, `activeProjectId`, `currentStep`, `phase`, `completedSteps`, `projectName`, `liveUrl`, `githubUrl`, `userName`, `vibe`, `idea`. (Messages are NOT persisted via Zustand — they use a separate file-based persistence hook.)\n\n**`ChatMessage` type:**\n```ts\n{\n  id: string;\n  role: \"user\" | \"assistant\" | \"status\";\n  content: string;\n  timestamp: number;\n  toolName?: string;\n  toolInput?: { file_path?: string; command?: string };\n  questionData?: {\n    questions: Array<{\n      question: string;\n      options: Array<{ label: string; description: string }>;\n    }>;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**`ProjectMeta` type:**\n```ts\n{\n  id, name, displayName, path, createdAt, lastOpenedAt,\n  sessionId, locale, vibe, audience, priority, designRef, liveUrl, githubUrl\n}\n```\n\n**`loadProject(meta)`** restores all project fields and resets transient state (messages loaded by persistence hook separately).\n\n**`reset()`** returns the store to `initialState` (default locale is `\"he\"`).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Agent Client (`desktop/src/lib/agent-client.ts`)\n\n**`connectToAgent(options)`:**\n- POSTs to `/api/agent` with `{ prompt, locale, projectDir, sessionId }`.\n- Reads the SSE response stream line by line.\n- On `data: [DONE]` — calls `onDone()`.\n- Otherwise parses each JSON line via `parseAgentEvent(...)`.\n- Captures `session_id` from `result` events and calls `onSessionId`.\n- Handles block deduplication: Claude CLI stream-json sends cumulative `assistant` events (each event contains ALL blocks so far), so `lastAssistantBlockCount` tracks how many blocks have already been processed, and `skipBlocks` is passed to `parseAgentEvent` to only process new ones.\n- Returns `{ abort() }` which calls `controller.abort()`.\n\n**`parseAgentEvent(raw, locale, callbacks?, skipBlocks)`:**\n\n| Event type | Action |\n|---|---|\n| `system`, `rate_limit_event`, `user` | Skipped (null message) |\n| `assistant` + text block | Returns `{ role: \"assistant\", content: text }`. Scans for Vercel URL (`*.vercel.app`), calls `onLiveUrl`. |\n| `assistant` + `Bash` tool | Translates command to friendly status message. Detects `npm run dev` → calls `onDevServerDetected`. Detects `progress.sh complete N` → calls `onStepCompleted(N)`. |\n| `assistant` + `Write` tool | Returns status \"Creating filename...\" + calls `onFileChanged`. |\n| `assistant` + `Edit` tool | Returns status \"Editing filename...\" + calls `onFileChanged`. |\n| `assistant` + `Glob/Grep/Read` | Skipped (null). |\n| `assistant` + `AskUserQuestion` | Returns `{ role: \"assistant\", toolName: \"AskUserQuestion\", questionData: toolInput }`. |\n| `result` error | Returns generic error status message. |\n| `result` success | Returns null (content already streamed). |\n\n**`/api/agent` route (`desktop/src/app/api/agent/route.ts`):**\n- Spawns `claude --print --output-format stream-json --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose [--resume sessionId] [prompt]`.\n- `stdin: \"ignore\"` (critical — piped stdin causes claude to hang).\n- Deletes `CLAUDECODE` env var to allow nesting.\n- `cwd` set to `projectDir`.\n- Streams stdout as SSE `data:` lines. Stderr warnings forwarded as error events if they contain \"Error\".\n\n---\n\n## 5. Chat Components (`desktop/src/components/chat/`)\n\n**ChatPanel.tsx:** Composes the chat column in this order:\n1. `ConversationRecoveryBanner` — shown when a session was restored\n2. `PlanningHeader` — shown during planning phase (steps 1–3)\n3. `ChatHistory` — scrollable message list\n4. `LiveActivityBar` — live \"Building...\" status bar\n5. `ChatInput` — text input + send button\n\n**ChatHistory.tsx:** Reads `store.messages`, pipes them through `buildActivityBlocks()` (from `@/lib/activity-blocks`), then renders each as `<ActivityBlockView>`. Auto-scrolls on message changes. The last block is marked `isActive: true` while streaming.\n\n**ChatInput.tsx:** Simple controlled input. Disabled while `isStreaming`. On submit, calls `onSend(input.trim())`.\n\n**QuestionCard.tsx:** Renders `AskUserQuestion` tool output as clickable option buttons. Clicking a button calls `onAnswer(opt.label)`, which feeds back into the agent.\n\n**LiveActivityBar.tsx:** Animated bar at the bottom of the chat (above input). Visible only when `isStreaming && currentActivity`. Shows a spinner + the current activity text (e.g., \"Setting up your project...\").\n\n**PlanningHeader.tsx:** Shown when `currentStep <= 3`. Displays the mascot image, \"Let's plan your project\" title, and subtitle. Animates out when step advances past 3.\n\n**Message.tsx, AssistantMessage.tsx, UserMessage.tsx, BuildingBlock.tsx, ErrorMessage.tsx, ActivityBlockView.tsx** — Individual message display components (inferred from file listing).\n\n**ConversationRecoveryBanner.tsx** — Banner shown when a conversation was restored from disk.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Step Indicator (`desktop/src/components/progress/StepIndicator.tsx`)\n\nReads `currentStep` and `completedSteps` from store. Displays:\n- Phase labels: iterates `PHASES`, marks each as `isActive` (current step in that phase's step list) or `isDone` (all steps in phase completed).\n- A progress bar: `completedSteps.length / TOTAL_STEPS * 100` width.\n\nUses `PhaseLabel` sub-component (not fully explored but referenced).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Progress Config (`desktop/src/lib/progress-config.ts`)\n\n```ts\nexport const PHASES = [\n  { phase: 0, steps: [1, 2], key: \"phase0\" },  // Setup\n  { phase: 1, steps: [3, 4], key: \"phase1\" },  // Build\n  { phase: 2, steps: [5, 6], key: \"phase2\" },  // Improve\n  { phase: 3, steps: [7, 8, 9], key: \"phase3\" }, // Launch\n] as const;\n\nexport const TOTAL_STEPS = 9;\n\nexport function getPhaseForStep(step: number): number {\n  if (step <= 2) return 0;\n  if (step <= 4) return 1;\n  if (step <= 6) return 2;\n  return 3;\n}\n```\n\n**Step-to-phase mapping:**\n- Steps 1–2: Phase 0 (Setup)\n- Steps 3–4: Phase 1 (Build)\n- Steps 5–6: Phase 2 (Improve)\n- Steps 7–9: Phase 3 (Launch)\n\n---\n\n## 8. Milestone Extractor (`desktop/src/lib/milestone-extractor.ts`)\n\n**`extractMilestone(msg, locale)`:** Inspects a `ChatMessage` and returns a `ProjectMilestone | null`:\n- `create-next-app` or `npm init` → `type: \"build\"`, label \"Project created\"\n- `npm run dev` or `next dev` → `type: \"build\"`, label \"First version built\"\n- `vercel` or `deploy` → `type: \"publish\"`, label \"Site published\"\n- `Write` or `Edit` tool → `type: \"change\"`, label \"Edited: filename\"\n- Assistant text with `vercel.app` or \"your site is live\" → `type: \"publish\"`, label \"Site is live!\"\n\n**`createMilestoneThrottler(locale)`:** Returns a throttled version of `extractMilestone`. File-change milestones (`type: \"change\"`) are deduplicated within a 10-second window and generalized to \"Made changes\".\n\n**`ProjectMilestone` type:**\n```ts\n{ id: string; type: \"choice\" | \"build\" | \"change\" | \"publish\" | \"other\"; label: string; timestamp: number; }\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. i18n Messages\n\nBoth `en.json` and `he.json` share the same structure. Key namespaces:\n\n| Namespace | Purpose |\n|---|---|\n| `App` | App title and logo text |\n| `Setup` | Pre-build loading/setup screen |\n| `Welcome` | Welcome page — greetings, vibe/audience/priority options, \"Start Building\" |\n| `Build` | Build page — status messages, chat input, preview controls |\n| `Ship` | Publishing flow messages |\n| `Done` | Completion screen |\n| `Progress` | Phase labels: \"Setup\", \"Build\", \"Improve\", \"Launch\" |\n| `Errors` | Error messages |\n| `Project` | Relative time labels (\"Just now\", \"Yesterday\", \"N days ago\") |\n| `Planning` | Planning header: \"Let's plan your project\" + subtitle |\n| `Chat` | \"Conversation restored\" banner |\n| `Agent` | Agent status messages |\n| `ProjectPanel` | Project drawer: choices, timeline, activity log, quick actions, step labels (step1–step9), phase labels |\n\nThe `ProjectPanel` namespace has full step labels:\n- step1: \"Check environment\" / \"בדיקת סביבה\"\n- step2: \"Meet & greet\" / \"היכרות\"\n- step3: \"Gather ideas\" / \"איסוף רעיונות\"\n- step4: \"Build first version\" / \"בניית גרסה ראשונה\"\n- step5: \"Review together\" / \"סקירה משותפת\"\n- step6: \"Make improvements\" / \"שיפורים\"\n- step7: \"Final check\" / \"בדיקה אחרונה\"\n- step8: \"Publish online\" / \"פרסום באינטרנט\"\n- step9: \"Celebrate!\" / \"חגיגה!\"\n\n---\n\n## 10. CC4D Skill (`skills/cc4d/SKILL.md`)\n\n9 steps across 4 phases, driven by `bash scripts/progress.sh`:\n\n| Phase | Steps | What happens |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0: Setup | 1–2 | Environment check (`01-check-environment.sh`), Orient user (warm greeting) |\n| 1: Build | 3–4 | Gather idea via `AskUserQuestion` (vibe/audience/priority/design ref), Scaffold Next.js + agentation + build |\n| 2: Iterate | 5–6 | React & iterate (feedback loop), Save progress |\n| 3: Shipping | 7–9 | Offer to ship, GitHub + Vercel deploy, Celebrate |\n\nKey rules: `progress.sh complete N` is what triggers `onStepCompleted(N)` in the frontend (detected via bash command pattern match `progress\\.sh\\s+complete\\s+(\\d+)`). The skill uses `AskUserQuestion` tool for structured choices. Long-running commands must use `run_in_background: true`.\n\n**Step 3 (Gather idea):** Uses `AskUserQuestion` to collect vibe (4 options), audience (4 options), priority (4 options), design reference (Yes/No). If user provides a design URL, Claude uses WebFetch to analyze it. If \"surprise me\", Claude internally generates a detailed spec but does NOT show it to the user.\n\n**Step 4 (Scaffold and Build):** `npx create-next-app`, install `agentation`, create `app/agentation-wrapper.tsx` (must be `\"use client\"`), run `npm run build` to verify before showing the user, then `npm run dev`.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Types (`desktop/src/types/electron-api.d.ts`)\n\nDeclares `window.electronAPI` with these methods:\n- `getSystemLocale()` → `\"he\" | \"en\"`\n- `getRuntimeStatus()` → `{ nodeReady, gitReady, claudeReady }`\n- `openProject(path)` — opens folder in OS file explorer\n- `createProject(idea, locale)` → `ProjectMeta`\n- `listProjects()` → `ProjectMeta[]`\n- `switchProject(id)` → `ProjectMeta | null`\n- `updateProject(id, updates)` → `ProjectMeta | null`\n- `getActiveProject()` → `ProjectMeta | null`\n- `openExternal(url)` — opens URL in system browser\n- `onAgentMessage/onAgentError` — IPC event listeners\n- `loadChatHistory(projectPath)` / `saveChatHistory(projectPath, messages)` — file-based persistence\n- `finalizePreferences(projectId, { idea, vibe, audience, priority, designRef })` — saves onboarding choices\n- `pollPort(port)` → `boolean` — checks if a local port is accepting connections\n- `loadMilestones/saveMilestones` — per-project milestone persistence\n- `getLogPath()`, `logToFile(level, message)` — logging\n- `platform: string`, `isPackaged: boolean` — platform info\n\n---\n\n## 12. PlanningHeader (`desktop/src/components/chat/PlanningHeader.tsx`)\n\nVisible when `currentStep <= 3`. Shows:\n- Mascot image (waving pose, 120×120)\n- `t(\"Planning.title\")` = \"Let's plan your project\"\n- `t(\"Planning.subtitle\")` = \"I'll ask a few questions so I can build exactly what you need\"\n\nAnimates out (height collapses, opacity fades) when step advances to 4+.\n\n---\n\n## 13. Project Components (`desktop/src/components/project/`)\n\n**ProjectDrawer.tsx:** Full-height side drawer (380px wide). In RTL (Hebrew), slides from the right; in LTR slides from the left. Contains:\n1. `ProjectIdentityCard` — mascot + project name + phase badge + \"Live\" link button\n2. `ProjectChoicesCard` — vibe/audience/priority/designRef rows (hidden if no choices made)\n3. `ProjectTimeline` — 9-step visual timeline with phase grouping, completed/active/pending states\n4. `ProjectActivityLog` — chronological list of milestones (newest first, max 20)\n5. `ProjectQuickActions` — \"Open folder\", \"Visit site\", \"New project\" buttons (with confirmation for new project)\n\n**ProjectDrawerToggle.tsx:** A `PanelLeft` icon button that calls `store.toggleProjectDrawer()`.\n\n**ProjectTimeline.tsx:** Renders all 9 steps grouped by phase. Each step shows a circle (filled black = completed, yellow ring = current, empty = pending) and its translated label from `ProjectPanel.step1`–`step9`.\n\n**ProjectChoicesCard.tsx:** Shows `vibe`, `audience`, `priority`, `designRef` as icon rows. Hidden entirely if no choices exist yet.\n\n**ProjectIdentityCard.tsx:** Shows `store.idea` as project display name, current phase badge, and a \"Live\" button if `store.liveUrl` is set.\n\n**ProjectActivityLog.tsx:** Milestone entries with type icons (sparkles for choice, hammer for build, pencil for change, rocket for publish). Timestamps formatted as HH:MM.\n\n**ProjectQuickActions.tsx:** Pinned to drawer bottom. Has a \"start new project\" confirmation dialog that triggers on the New Project button when `isStreaming` is true."}],"totalDurationMs":140894,"totalTokens":65815,"totalToolUseCount":32,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2630,"cache_read_input_tokens":58115,"output_tokens":5069,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2630,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"e5c526a8-140d-405c-b950-d26f0d6dd0b4"}

This skill walks you through the entire process — from first conversation to a live URL — step by step.\nmetadata:\n  author: Michaelliv\n  version: \"3.0\"\n  series: cc-for-dummies\n---\n\n# Claude Code for Dummies\n\nYou are guiding a non-technical person through building something with Claude Code. This is a structured, step-by-step process. You do not decide what step you're on — the progress script does.\n\n## How This Works\n\n1. Run `bash scripts/progress.sh next` to get your current step instructions\n2. Follow the ACTION in the step\n3. Verify the CHECK passes\n4. Save what you learned to CLAUDE.md (every step has a CAPTURE section)\n5. Run `bash scripts/progress.sh complete N` to advance to the next step\n6. Repeat\n\n**Never skip steps. Never guess what step you're on. Always ask the progress script.**\n\n## Rules\n\n- Use plain language. No jargon. If you must use a technical term, explain it in parentheses.\n- Action first, explanation second. Do things, then tell them what you did.\n- Fix, don't instruct. When something is broken, fix it yourself.\n- Only pause for genuine user action: account signups, giving feedback, making decisions.\n- Permission key is **Enter** to approve, **Escape** to deny. Never say \"press Y\".\n- No time promises. Never say \"30 seconds\" or \"in a minute\". Never set timeouts on commands — if a command might take a while, use `run_in_background: true` instead.\n- Long-running commands (`npx create-next-app`, `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npx vercel`) **must** use `run_in_background: true`. Never use `&` to background a command. Never set a timeout hoping it'll finish in time. Use `TaskOutput` to check on progress or wait for completion.\n- Pick sensible defaults. Never ask the user to choose between technical options.\n- After EVERY step, update CLAUDE.md with what the CAPTURE section specifies. This is critical — if the user leaves and comes back, CLAUDE.md is all you have.\n\n## Starting a Session\n\n**New user (no .cc4d-progress.json):**\nRun `bash scripts/progress.sh next` — it will initialize at Step 1.\n\n**Returning user (.cc4d-progress.json exists):**\n1. Read CLAUDE.md to remember who they are and what they built\n2. Run `bash scripts/progress.sh status` to see where they left off\n3. Greet them by name\n4. Run `bash scripts/progress.sh next` and continue from where they stopped\n\n## Progress Commands\n\n| Command | What it does |\n|---|---|\n| `bash scripts/progress.sh next` | Show current step instructions |\n| `bash scripts/progress.sh complete N` | Mark step N done, show next step |\n| `bash scripts/progress.sh status` | Show progress summary |\n| `bash scripts/progress.sh reset` | Start over from Step 1 |\n\n## The Steps\n\n9 steps across 4 phases. You don't need to know them all — `progress.sh next` gives you one at a time.\n\n| Phase | Steps | What happens |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0: Setup | 1-2 | Environment check, orientation |\n| 1: Build | 3-4 | Gather idea with AskUserQuestion, scaffold Next.js + agentation, build first version |\n| 2: Iterate | 5-6 | React & iterate (feedback loop with agentation), save progress |\n| 3: Shipping | 7-9 | Offer to ship, GitHub + Vercel deploy, celebrate |\n\n## References\n\n- `references/feedback-cheatsheet.md` — Agentation usage, feedback phrases, plan mode guide\n- `references/shipping-reference.md` — GitHub/Vercel commands, auto-deploy explanation\n\n## Begin\n\nRun `bash scripts/progress.sh next` now.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":65,"oldLines":6,"newStart":65,"newLines":26,"lines":[" | 2: Iterate | 5-6 | React & iterate (feedback loop with agentation), save progress |"," | 3: Shipping | 7-9 | Offer to ship, GitHub + Vercel deploy, celebrate |"," ","+## Workspace Mode","+","+When the user's first message starts with `[WORKSPACE MODE]`, the project already has a first build and the user is returning to make changes.

Here's a summary of all changes made:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n### New Files\n- **`desktop/src/components/chat/SuggestionChips.tsx`** — Quick-start action chips (\"Add a feature\", \"Fix something\", \"Change design\") shown above the chat input in workspace mode. Chips animate in, prefill the input on click, and disappear after the first message.\n- **`desktop/src/components/build/WorkspaceHeader.tsx`** — Replaces the step indicator in workspace mode. Shows back arrow, project name, status badge (Live/Local), and a Deploy button.\n\n### Modified Files\n\n**`desktop/src/lib/store.ts`**\n- Added `isWorkspaceMode` and `chipsVisible` state fields\n- Added `setWorkspaceMode()` and `hideChips()` actions\n- `loadProject()` now auto-detects workspace mode when `meta.sessionId` exists\n- `isWorkspaceMode` is persisted to survive page reloads\n\n**`desktop/src/app/welcome/page.tsx`** — Redesigned as a project hub:\n- **Returning users** (have projects): Projects are the hero with vertical cards showing status badges (Live/Local/In Progress) and relative time. \"Build something new\" is a secondary outline button.\n- **New users** (no projects): Original hero CTA unchanged.\n\n**`desktop/src/app/build/page.tsx`**\n- Workspace mode detection: shows `WorkspaceHeader` instead of `StepIndicator`, hides the feedback banner, sends `[WORKSPACE MODE]` context to agent instead of \"Hey! I'm ready to start\"\n- Auto-polls port 3000 for dev server on workspace entry\n- Added `handleDeploy()` that sends a deploy prompt to the agent\n- Passes `isWorkspaceMode` to `ChatPanel`\n\n**`desktop/src/components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx`**\n- Accepts `isWorkspaceMode` prop\n- Hides `PlanningHeader` in workspace mode\n- Shows `SuggestionChips` in workspace mode\n- Manages prefill state for chip → input flow\n\n**`desktop/src/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx`**\n- Added `prefill` and `onPrefillConsumed` props for chip prefill support\n- Added input ref for auto-focus after prefill\n\n**`desktop/messages/en.json` + `he.json`**\n- Added `Workspace` namespace with deploy, chip labels, and chip prefill strings\n- Added `Welcome.buildSomethingNew`, `Welcome.yourProjects`, `Welcome.hubGreeting`, and status badge strings\n\n**`skills/cc4d/SKILL.md`**\n- Added \"Workspace Mode\" section instructing Claude to skip the step system, read CLAUDE.md, start dev server, wait for user's task, and handle deploy requests\n\n**`desktop/src/lib/progress-config.ts`** — Fixed pre-existing type error (`as const` readonly tuple vs mutable `number[]`)."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":667,"cache_read_input_tokens":91547,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":667},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYEwgzR4KoWwL5xaG1iH2","type":"assistant","uuid":"1df37785-cda1-4e39-846c-330257a39433","timestamp":"2026-02-18T04:59:23.578Z"}
