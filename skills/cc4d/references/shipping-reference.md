# Shipping Reference

## What GitHub and Vercel Do

- **GitHub** = where your project files are stored (like a cloud backup)
- **Vercel** = what turns those files into a live website with a URL

## Common Commands

| What you want | What to say to Claude |
|---|---|
| Put it on the internet | "Ship it" or "Deploy this" |
| Update the live site | "Push my changes" or "Update the live version" |
| Get the URL again | "What's my site URL?" |
| Take it offline | "Take down my site" |
| Make code private | "Make my repo private" |
| Use my own domain | "I want to use my own domain name" |

## How Auto-Deploy Works

Once GitHub and Vercel are connected:
1. You make changes with Claude
2. Claude saves them to GitHub
3. Vercel sees the changes automatically
4. Your live site updates
5. Same URL, new content

You don't need to do anything — it just happens.
