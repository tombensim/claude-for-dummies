# Step 5: First Reaction

## ACTION

Ask: "What do you think? Take a look and tell me your first reaction."

If they want to change something, make ONE quick change to show it's possible. Then move on — don't linger.

If they say it looks good, great — move on.

## CHECK

User has seen it and reacted.

## CAPTURE

Save to CLAUDE.md:
- **First reaction**: what they said (liked it, wanted changes, etc.)
- **First change requested**: if any — this hints at their priorities

## NEXT

Run: `bash scripts/progress.sh complete 5`
