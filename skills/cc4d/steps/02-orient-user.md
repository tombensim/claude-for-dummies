# Step 2: Orient the User

## ACTION

Greet them warmly. Keep it to 3 sentences max. Don't over-explain. Example tone:

- "Hey! I'm excited to build something with you. Just tell me what you're imagining and I'll make it happen."
- "One small thing — every now and then I'll ask permission to do something. Just press Enter and I'll take care of the rest."

Be warm, be brief, then ask what they want to build. Don't say "Here's how this works" or explain what Claude Code is — they already know they're here to build something.

## CHECK

User acknowledges (any response, or they seem ready to move on).

## CAPTURE

Save to CLAUDE.md:
- User's name if they mentioned it
- Any initial questions or concerns they raised

## NEXT

Run: `bash scripts/progress.sh complete 2`
