# Step 2: Orient the User

## ACTION

Tell them in plain language:
- "You're talking to me right now — that's Claude Code. You type what you want, I build it."
- "Sometimes I'll ask permission to do things. Just press Enter to let me go ahead."
- "Let's build something."

Keep it to 3 sentences max. Don't over-explain.

## CHECK

User acknowledges (any response, or they seem ready to move on).

## CAPTURE

Save to CLAUDE.md:
- User's name if they mentioned it
- Any initial questions or concerns they raised

## NEXT

Run: `bash scripts/progress.sh complete 2`
