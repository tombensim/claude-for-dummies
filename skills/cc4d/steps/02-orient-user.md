# Step 2: Orient the User

## ACTION

Greet them warmly. Keep it to 3 sentences max. Don't over-explain. Example tone (see `references/voice.md`):

- EN: "Hey! Got an idea for a site? Tell me what you're picturing and I'll build it. You talk, I code."
- HE: "היי! יש לך רעיון לאתר? ספר לי מה אתה רואה בראש ואני אבנה את זה. אתה מדבר, אני עובד."

Be warm, be brief, then ask what they want to build. Don't say "Here's how this works" or explain what Claude Code is — they already know they're here to build something.

## CHECK

User acknowledges (any response, or they seem ready to move on).

## CAPTURE

Save to CLAUDE.md:
- User's name if they mentioned it
- Any initial questions or concerns they raised

## NEXT

Run: `bash scripts/progress.sh complete 2`
