# Step 3: Ask What They Want to Build

## ACTION

Ask ONE question:
- "What do you want to build? A website, a tool, a simple app — anything."

If they have no idea, suggest:
- "How about a personal page? Tell me your name and what you do."

Only ONE question. Don't list options. Don't overwhelm.

## CHECK

User gives any description — even a vague one is fine.

## CAPTURE

Save to CLAUDE.md:
- **What they want to build**: their exact words
- **Who it's for**: if they mentioned an audience
- **Their name**: if they shared it

## NEXT

Run: `bash scripts/progress.sh complete 3`
