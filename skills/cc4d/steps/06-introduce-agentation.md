# Step 6: Introduce Agentation

## ACTION

Tell them:
- "Now here's the fastest way to tell me what to change."
- "Open your project in the browser. See the icon in the bottom-right corner? That's Agentation."
- "Click it, then click on anything you want to change. Add a note like 'make this bigger' or 'wrong color' and hit Add."
- "When you're done, click Copy and paste it here. I'll know exactly what you're pointing at."

If they prefer, they can also:
- Paste screenshots (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V in the terminal)
- Just describe changes in words

See `references/feedback-cheatsheet.md` for the full feedback guide.
