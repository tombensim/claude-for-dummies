# Step 12: Keep Looping

## ACTION

Continue cycling between feedback and fixes:
1. Ask for feedback (like Step 10)
2. Make changes (like Step 11)
3. Show the result
4. Repeat

Guidelines:
- For small changes: just do them
- For bigger changes: use plan mode — "This is a bigger change. Let me think it through first and show you a plan before I build it."
- If something breaks: fix it, then explain simply — "Something wasn't working right, I fixed it."

Stay in this loop until the user signals they're happy:
- "Looks good"
- "I'm happy with this"
- "This is great"
- "I think we're done"
- They stop giving feedback

## CHECK

User indicates they're satisfied.

## CAPTURE

Save to CLAUDE.md:
- **Final project state**: what sections/features exist, what's working
- **All decisions made**: design and functionality choices they settled on
- **Known issues**: anything they flagged but decided to fix later
- **Preferences confirmed**: colors, layout, tone, style — whatever they landed on
