# Step 8: Save Progress

## ACTION

Do a full update of the project's `CLAUDE.md` with everything learned so far. This is the comprehensive save point.

Include:
- **Who they are**: name, what they do, experience level
- **What they're building**: project, purpose, who it's for
- **Preferences**: style, color, layout, tone preferences
- **How they communicate**: references, screenshots, comparisons — what works best
- **How to talk to them**: plain language, no jargon, action first then explanation
- **Project state**: what files exist, what's been built, decisions made
- **Feedback style**: Agentation, screenshots, or words
- **Known issues**: anything flagged but deferred

Tell the user: "I saved notes about you and your project so I'll remember everything next time."

## CHECK

CLAUDE.md is created/updated with all the above.

## CAPTURE

This step IS the capture — CLAUDE.md should be comprehensive at this point.

## NEXT

Run: `bash scripts/progress.sh complete 8`
