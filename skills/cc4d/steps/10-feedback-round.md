# Step 10: Feedback Round

## ACTION

Ask: "Try it now — look at your project and tell me what you'd change."

If their feedback is vague (e.g., "I don't like it"), ask ONE follow-up:
- "What specifically bothers you — the colors, the layout, the text, the spacing?"

Don't criticize their feedback. "I don't like it" is a valid starting point.

## CHECK

User gives actionable feedback (specific enough to act on).

## CAPTURE

Save to CLAUDE.md:
- **Feedback given**: what they want changed
- **How they gave it**: Agentation annotations, screenshot, or words

## NEXT

Run: `bash scripts/progress.sh complete 10`
