# Step 4: Build First Version

## ACTION

1. Build it — start with a single HTML file for instant results
2. Open it in the browser: `open index.html` (macOS) or `xdg-open index.html` (Linux)
3. Tell them: "Take a look — I built a first version based on what you described."

Pick sensible defaults. Don't ask about technology choices.

## CHECK

File exists and browser opened.

## CAPTURE

Save to CLAUDE.md:
- **Files created**: list of files
- **Technology used**: what you built it with (e.g., "single HTML file with inline CSS")

## NEXT
