# Step 6: Teach Description Skills

## ACTION

Point out what was useful in their original description. Reinforce by example:

- If they described what it DOES: "That was great — telling me what it does is the most useful thing you can say."
- If they gave a reference: "Comparing to another site or product is super helpful — do that anytime."
- If they said what they DON'T want: "Telling me what you don't want is just as useful as what you do want."

Also teach:
- "You can paste screenshots of things you like and say 'make it look like this'"
- "You can say things like 'like Airbnb but for dog walkers' — that tells me a lot"

Keep it brief — 2-3 tips max based on what's relevant to their project.
