But once a user has a live project, they need ongoing workflows: adding features, fixing bugs, implementing feedback, changing design. Today, clicking a recent project dumps you back into `/build` at whatever step you left off, with no clear UX for these iterative tasks. The linear step system doesn't accommodate \"go back and keep working.\"\n\n**The long-term value of CC4D isn't the first build — it's the ongoing relationship.** Building is a one-time event; maintaining and evolving is where users spend most of their time.\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n\n**Maria** — built a portfolio site last week. Wants to add a \"Contact Me\" form. She doesn't need setup or scaffolding. She needs to describe what she wants, watch it happen, and deploy.\n\n**Yossi** — his landing page has a broken mobile layout. A friend found the bug. He needs to explain the issue, have Claude fix it, verify, and deploy.\n\n**Dani** — got feedback that her event registration is confusing. She wants to paste the feedback, have Claude improve the flow, review the changes, and push live.\n\n**Amir** — changed his mind about his site's colors. Wants to describe the new look, see it in preview, and deploy when happy.\n\n### Common Pattern\n\nAll iterative workflows share:\n1. **Resume context** — Claude needs to understand the existing project (CLAUDE.md + git history already provide this)\n2. **Express intent** — User describes what they want\n3. **Watch it happen** — Same build experience with live preview\n4. **Review & iterate** — Same feedback loop as step 5\n5. **Deploy update** — Push changes live\n\nThe difference from \"build from scratch\": no setup, no scaffolding, no idea gathering. The user arrives with a **specific task**, not a blank canvas.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed UX: Two Modes\n\n### Mode 1: Guided Build (existing, unchanged)\n- Linear 9-step wizard\n- For brand-new projects\n- Mascot guides you through every step\n\n### Mode 2: Workspace (new)\n- Free-form, task-oriented\n- For returning to existing projects (step 4+ completed)\n- Same chat + preview layout, different chrome and entry point\n\nThe mode is **automatically determined**: if a project has completed at least step 4 (first build exists), it opens in Workspace mode. Mid-wizard projects resume the wizard.\n\n---\n\n## Design: Welcome Page as Project Hub\n\n### Current\n- Flat list of recent projects as small horizontal cards\n- One big \"Start Building\" CTA\n- No project status info\n\n### Proposed\n- **Returning users** (have projects): Projects are the hero, \"Build something new\" is secondary\n- **New users** (no projects): \"Build something new\" is the hero with full onboarding\n\nEach project card shows:\n- Project name\n- **Status badge**: \"Live\" (green, has vercel URL), \"Local\" (yellow, built but not deployed), \"In Progress\" (building)\n- Last activity time\n- Live URL (if deployed) as a subtle link\n\n```\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  [Mascot waving]                                  │\n│  \"Hi!

The project is past the wizard.\n2. **Context loading** — Read CLAUDE.md (already has all CAPTURE data from steps 1-9), `git log --oneline -10` for recent history\n3. **Dev server** — Start `npm run dev` if not already running\n4. **Wait for user** — Don't send an introductory message. The user's first message IS the task.\n5. **Task execution** — Same principles: plain language, fix don't instruct, pick sensible defaults\n6. **Deployment** — When user says \"deploy\" or clicks the button, run `git add -A && git commit && vercel --prod --yes`\n\n### Initial Prompt Format (Desktop → Agent)\n\nFor workspace mode, the desktop app sends a **system context message** (not a user prompt):\n\n```\n[WORKSPACE MODE]\nThe user is returning to an existing project. Do NOT run the step system.\nRead CLAUDE.md for project context.

User can expand to review, but focus is on the new task. On each new workspace entry, archive the previous session.\n2. **Dev server**: Auto-start on entry — preview appears immediately when opening the project. Feels responsive and alive.\n3. **Deploy**: Header button + chat — a Deploy button always visible in the workspace header AND available as a chat command.

This is a structured, step-by-step process. You do not decide what step you're on — the progress script does.\n    13→\n    14→## How This Works\n    15→\n    16→1. Run `bash scripts/progress.sh next` to get your current step instructions\n    17→2. Follow the ACTION in the step\n    18→3. Verify the CHECK passes\n    19→4. Save what you learned to CLAUDE.md (every step has a CAPTURE section)\n    20→5. Run `bash scripts/progress.sh complete N` to advance to the next step\n    21→6. Repeat\n    22→\n    23→**Never skip steps. Never guess what step you're on. Always ask the progress script.**\n    24→\n    25→## Rules\n    26→\n    27→- Use plain language. No jargon. If you must use a technical term, explain it in parentheses.\n    28→- Action first, explanation second. Do things, then tell them what you did.\n    29→- Fix, don't instruct. When something is broken, fix it yourself.\n    30→- Only pause for genuine user action: account signups, giving feedback, making decisions.\n    31→- Permission key is **Enter** to approve, **Escape** to deny. Never say \"press Y\".\n    32→- No time promises. Never say \"30 seconds\" or \"in a minute\". Never set timeouts on commands — if a command might take a while, use `run_in_background: true` instead.\n    33→- Long-running commands (`npx create-next-app`, `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npx vercel`) **must** use `run_in_background: true`. Never use `&` to background a command. Never set a timeout hoping it'll finish in time. Use `TaskOutput` to check on progress or wait for completion.\n    34→- Pick sensible defaults. Never ask the user to choose between technical options.\n    35→- After EVERY step, update CLAUDE.md with what the CAPTURE section specifies. This is critical — if the user leaves and comes back, CLAUDE.md is all you have.\n    36→\n    37→## Starting a Session\n    38→\n    39→**New user (no .cc4d-progress.json):**\n    40→Run `bash scripts/progress.sh next` — it will initialize at Step 1.\n    41→\n    42→**Returning user (.cc4d-progress.json exists):**\n    43→1. Read CLAUDE.md to remember who they are and what they built\n    44→2. Run `bash scripts/progress.sh status` to see where they left off\n    45→3. Greet them by name\n    46→4.
