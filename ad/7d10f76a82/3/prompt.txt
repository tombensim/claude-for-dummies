Implement the following plan:

# Delete Projects Feature

## Context
The welcome page lists projects but has no way to remove them. Users accumulate test projects and want to clean up. The `removeProject()` function already exists in `electron/project-store.mjs` but is never wired to IPC or exposed to the renderer.

## Changes

### 1. IPC handler — `project:delete`
**File:** `electron/ipc-handlers.js`

Add a new `project:delete` handler that:
- Looks up the project by id to get its `path`
- Calls `projectStore.removeProject(id)` to remove from electron-store
- If `deleteFiles` is true, uses `fs.rm(project.path, { recursive: true, force: true })` to delete the folder
- Logs the action
- Returns `{ success: true }` or throws

### 2. Preload bridge
**File:** `electron/preload.js`

Add `deleteProject` method that invokes `project:delete`.

### 3. TypeScript types
**File:** `src/types/electron-api.d.ts`

Add `deleteProject: (id: string, deleteFiles: boolean) => Promise<{ success: boolean }>` to the interface.

### 4. i18n strings
**Files:** `messages/he.json`, `messages/en.json`

Add under `"Welcome"`:
- `deleteProject`, `deleteConfirmTitle`, `deleteConfirmMessage`
- `deleteKeepFiles`, `deleteAndRemoveFiles`, `deleteCancel`

### 5. Delete button + confirmation modal on welcome page
**File:** `src/app/welcome/page.tsx`

- Add a `Trash2` icon button on each project card (visible on hover via group-hover)
- `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent card navigation
- Sets `deletingProject` state to show an inline confirmation modal
- Modal shows project name and three options:
  - "Just remove from list" → `deleteProject(id, false)`
  - "Also delete files from my computer" → `deleteProject(id, true)`
  - "Cancel"
- On confirm: call API, then filter the project from local `recentProjects` state
- Use `AnimatePresence` for smooth card removal animation

## Files Modified
1. `electron/ipc-handlers.js` — new `project:delete` IPC handler
2. `electron/preload.js` — expose `deleteProject`
3. `src/types/electron-api.d.ts` — type the new method
4. `messages/he.json` + `messages/en.json` — i18n strings
5. `src/app/welcome/page.tsx` — delete button + confirmation UI

## Verification
- `cd desktop && npm run dev`
- Open welcome page with existing projects
- Hover a project card → trash icon appears
- Click trash → confirmation modal appears
- Test "Just remove from list" → project disappears, files remain on disk
- Test "Also delete files" → project disappears, folder deleted
- Test cancel → nothing happens
- Verify RTL layout (Hebrew)
- Build check: `npx next build`
