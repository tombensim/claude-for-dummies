Implement the following plan:

# Fix Chat UX Issues

## Context
The desktop app's chat UI has several visual problems visible in the screenshot: repeated mascot avatars on every assistant message, building blocks that are nearly invisible against the yellow background, an overwhelming all-yellow color scheme, and the PlanningHeader taking up too much space once conversation starts.

## Changes

### 1. Group assistant messages under a single mascot
**Files:** `AssistantMessage.tsx`, `ActivityBlockView.tsx`

- Add `showAvatar?: boolean` prop to `AssistantMessage` (default `true`)
- When `showAvatar` is false, render a 36px-wide empty spacer div instead of the mascot (keeps bubble alignment)
- In `ActivityBlockView`, pass `showAvatar={idx === 0}` so only the first message in a block gets the mascot
- Wrap the assistant block messages in `<div className="space-y-1.5">` for tighter internal spacing

### 2. Make building blocks visible
**File:** `BuildingBlock.tsx`

- Container: `bg-dummy-black/5` → `bg-dummy-white/60 backdrop-blur-sm`
- Left border: `border-dummy-black/20` → `border-dummy-black/40`
- Summary text: `text-dummy-black/70` → `text-dummy-black/80`
- Icons: `text-dummy-black/50` → `text-dummy-black/60`

### 3. Improve chat area contrast
**Files:** `build/page.tsx`, `LiveActivityBar.tsx`

- Chat area bg: `bg-dummy-yellow-bright/30` → `bg-dummy-yellow/15` (lighter cream)
- LiveActivityBar: `bg-dummy-yellow-bright/40` → `bg-dummy-white/70` (frosted white strip)

### 4. Compact PlanningHeader after conversation starts
**File:** `PlanningHeader.tsx`

- Track `messages.length` from the store
- When `messageCount > 2`: switch to compact horizontal layout (32px mascot, single-line title, no subtitle) — reclaims ~150px of vertical space
- Use Framer Motion `layout` prop for smooth transition

## Verification
- Run `cd desktop && npm run dev`
- Start a new wizard session and verify: PlanningHeader shrinks after first exchange
- Send multiple messages and verify: assistant messages share one mascot per block
- Check building blocks are clearly visible against the background
- Verify RTL layout still works correctly (mascot on right side, text aligned properly)

I want to be able to delete projects (it should ask me if i want to remove them from my computer etc)
